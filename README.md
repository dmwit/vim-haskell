vim-haskell
===========

vim-haskell is a collection of things that I've modified over the years to make haskell development in vim more pleasant.  It includes:

 * Syntax highlighting that supports type and data families
 * Spell checking within comments
 * Indent to the furthest-right open grouping symbol
 * A compiler plugin for `cabal build` that processes output from GHC
 * A small collection of utilities for doing things like testing if a cabal file exists in the current directory
